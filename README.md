OVER VIEW 

     Systems: These are the servers and databases that store data and run the business logic. Developers write the backend code in various programming languages like JavaScript (Node.js), Python, Ruby, Java, C#, etc. This code handles requests from the frontend, performs operations such as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a database, and processes business logic.

    APIs: The backend exposes its functionality through APIs, which are sets of protocols and tools for building application software. APIs are designed to be consumed by different clients, including browsers, mobile applications, and other web services. The most common type of API used in web development is the RESTful API, but there are also others like GraphQL, SOAP, or even real-time APIs like WebSockets.

    Frontend Systems: This is the user interface that clients interact with. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, or frameworks/libraries like React, Angular, or Vue.js. The frontend makes requests to the backend via APIs to retrieve or send data. This data is then presented to the user in a structured and user-friendly manner.

    Data Exchange Formats: When the frontend sends a request to the backend (or vice versa), the data is typically serialized into a format that both sides understand. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the most widely used format for data exchange, but others like XML are also used.
    HTTP Requests: The communication between frontend and backend happens over the HTTP/HTTPS protocol. Frontend applications use HTTP methods like GET to retrieve data, POST to create data, PUT/PATCH to update data, and DELETE to remove data.

    Security: APIs need to be secured to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access. This is often done using various authentication and authorization techniques, such as API keys, OAuth, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), etc.
